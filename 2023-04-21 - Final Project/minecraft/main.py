# Get a world slice.
#
# A world slice contains all kinds of information about a slice of the world, like blocks, biomes
# and heightmaps. All of its data is extracted directly from Minecraft's chunk format:
# https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk_format. World slices take a while to load, but accessing
# data from them is very fast.
#
# To get a world slice, you need to specify a rectangular XZ-area using a Rect object (the 2D
# equivalent of a Box). Box.toRect() is a convenience function that converts a Box to its XZ-rect.
#
# Note that a world slice is a "snapshot" of the world: any changes you make to the world after
# loading a world slice are not reflected by it.

print("Loading world slice...")
buildRect = buildArea.toRect()
worldSlice = editor.loadWorldSlice(buildRect)
print("World slice loaded!")


# Most of worldSlice's functions have a "local" and a "global" variant. The local variant expects
# coordinates relatve to the rect with which it was constructed, while the global variant expects
# absolute coorndates.

vec = addY(buildRect.center, 30)
print(f"Block at {vec}: {worldSlice.getBlock(vec - buildArea.offset)}")
print(f"Block at {vec}: {worldSlice.getBlockGlobal(vec)}")


# Heightmaps are an easy way to get the uppermost block at any coordinate. They are very useful for
# writing terrain-adaptive generator algorithms.
# World slices provide access to the heightmaps that Minecraft stores in its chunk format, so you
# get their computation for free.
#
# By default, world slices load the following four heightmaps:
# - "WORLD_SURFACE":             The top non-air blocks.
# - "MOTION_BLOCKING":           The top blocks with a hitbox or fluid.
# - "MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES": Like MOTION_BLOCKING, but ignoring leaves.
# - "OCEAN_FLOOR":               The top non-air solid blocks.
#
# Heightmaps are loaded into 2D numpy arrays of Y coordinates.

print(f"Available heightmaps: {worldSlice.heightmaps.keys()}")

heightmap = worldSlice.heightmaps["MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES"]

print(f"Heightmap shape: {heightmap.shape}")

localCenter = buildRect.size // 2
# When indexing a numpy array with a vector, you need to convert to a tuple first.
centerHeight = heightmap[tuple(localCenter)]
centerTopBlock = worldSlice.getBlock(addY(localCenter, centerHeight - 1))
print(f"Top block at the center of the build area: {centerTopBlock}")
